## pt boundaries + info !

⁠♡‎‎ ‎ if nothing on my dni list applies to you ( said list can be found [here](https://burnt-letter.carrd.co) ), congrats! we're already off to a good start.

⁠♡‎‎ ‎ i'm perfectly fine with having others hide behind me, kisses, nuzzles & boops — even if we've never met before. physical affection is a **requirement** for me, so don't hold back on me.

⁠♡‎‎ ‎ i haven't roleplayed in a hot minute, but i guess you can ask me to rp with you if you really want that.

⁠♡ ‎ no copying my skins/sonas and trying to pass them off as your very own creations. otherwise, i'll be seeing you in court.

⁠♡ ‎ ponytown is like home to me and i tend to drop in after a long day. you'll either find me raving at an event server or just resting afk by myself.  the point is:  if i'm online, i'm up for interacting, so sit down with me before i come over there myself and start throwing hands.

⁠♡ ‎ if you ever spot me at an event server, you should totally come dance with me! i really love dancing in sync with others & i think it's a pretty fun way to slowly get over social anxiety :D
